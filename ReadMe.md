## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps challenge, I'm learning about how to build, deploy, and maintain a full DevOps pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Docker, and cloud infrastructure management. By the end of the 7 days, I will have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline, documented automation scripts, a clear folder structure with focused README files, and a complete, production-ready DevOps project hosted on GitHub that I can confidently showcase in my portfolio.

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 3 hours every day for a week to work on this challenge. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my progress in a daily log and updating my GitHub commits consistently to reflect what Iâ€™ve completed. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be publishing the project as a portfolio piece, adding it to my CV, and allowing myself a guilt-free chill day with no studying or work.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices. DevOps engineers build automated pipelines, containerize applications and turn cloud infrastructure into code.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment. This process helps teams by automatically deploying projects whenever a build is successful.
